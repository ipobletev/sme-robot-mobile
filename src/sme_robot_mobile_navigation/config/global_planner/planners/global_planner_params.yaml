# Global Planner Parameters

GlobalPlanner:
  use_dijkstra: false           # Use A* algorithm (true) instead of Dijkstra (false)
  use_quadratic: true           # Use quadratic approximation for distance calculation (more accurate)
  use_grid_path: false          # Use smoothed path for smoother paths (false). True = Follow the exact grid path
  allow_unknown: true           # Allow unknown space in the costmap to be considered
  default_tolerance: 0.1        # Tolerance in meters to reach the goal when the exact goal is not reachable. (0.0 exact point of goal)
  old_navfn_behavior: false     # Maintain compatibility with old navfn planner versions
  orientation_mode: 0           # Orientation Algorithm. 0=None, 1=Forward, 2=Interpolate, 3=ForwardSimple, 4=Backward, 5=Leftward, 6=Rightward. 0, The local planner decides the orientation
  orientation_window_size: 1    # Orientation window size for smoothing
  planner_window_x: 0.0         # 0 = use full costmap. > 0: Use the specified window size between the robot
  planner_window_y: 0.0         # 0 = use full costmap. > 0: Use the specified window size between the robot
  # Costmap parameters
  neutral_cost: 50              # Neutral cost: cells with this cost are considered free space
  cost_factor: 3.0              # Cost factor: multiplier for traversal cost
  lethal_cost: 253              # Lethal cost: cells with cost >= this are considered obstacles
  # Visualization parameters
  visualize_potential: false    # Visualization options /move_base/GlobalPlanner/plan (Path)
  publish_potential: true       # Publish potential map for visualization /move_base/GlobalPlanner/plan (Occupancy Grid)
  publish_scale: 100            # Publish scale for visualization
